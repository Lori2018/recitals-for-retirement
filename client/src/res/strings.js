    ourMission:
      "With the COVID-19 pandemic, residents at local assisted living and retirement facilities have been unable to meet loved ones. Our goal is to bring these residents some joy during these unprecedented events, achieved through the power of music. Students of all ages send videos of themselves playing a music instrument, singing, dancing, etc. We compile these videos together and send them to facilities as a “virtual recital” weekly/monthly. This not only brings some light to residents at these homes, but also provides a way for musically-inclined students to give back to their community and earn volunteer hours remotely. The concept has been initiated in a few facilities across the country, and we wish to expand it even further. Though this program was founded as a response to the pandemic, we plan to continue sending recitals to assisted living facilities regularly. Our program is based in North Carolina, but we accept videos from students and send recitals throughout the United States.",
    aboutUs:
      "Lori Brown, Ayush Khanna, and Charlotte Spurr are rising high school sophomores in Greensboro, North Carolina. Their interest in the intersection of the arts and community service led to the development of Recitals for Retirement, which gives young musicians a way to give back to their communities and remotely earn volunteer hours. Lori Brown has played the piano for eleven years, and the violin for nine years. She applies her passion of computer science to manage logistics. Ayush Khanna has played cello for four years, and is responsible for managing volunteer hours and video submissions to create the virtual recitals, also spreading the word to potential facilities and participants. Charlotte Spurr has played viola for over three years and spreads the word to facilities and music teachers across the country, expanding the program. All three co-founders have participated in local youth orchestras and various string festivals. They share a love for their community, and desire to bring the soothing powers of music and youth to residents at assisted-living facilities.",
