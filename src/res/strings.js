    ourMission:
      "With the Covid-19 pandemic, residents at local assisted living and retirement facilities have been unable to meet loved ones. Our goal is to bring these residents some joy during these unprecedented events, achieved through the power of music. Students of all ages send videos of themselves playing a music instrument, singing, dancing, etc. We compile these videos together and send them to facilities as a “virtual recital” weekly/monthly. This not only brings some light to residents at these homes, but also provides a way for musically-inclined students to give back to their community and earn volunteer hours remotely. The concept has been initiated in a few facilities across the country, and we wish to expand it even further. Though this program was founded as a response to the pandemic, we plan to continue sending recitals to assisted living facilities regularly. Our program is based in North Carolina, but we accept videos from students and send recitals throughout the United States.",
